# Discovery Document: SlackShots

## 1. Core Concept & Purpose

SlackShots is a web-based application designed to be a "fast, private, and intelligent file management for Slack". It aims to solve the problem of finding and managing files within a user's Slack workspace, which can become difficult as the volume of files grows. The application provides a dedicated interface for users to browse, search, and manage their Slack files, with a focus on speed, privacy, and "search that actually understands you."

## 2. Target Audience

The primary target audience for SlackShots is individuals and teams who heavily rely on Slack for communication and file sharing. This includes:

*   **Remote teams:** Who use Slack as their virtual office.
*   **Design and creative teams:** Who share a large number of visual assets.
*   **Software development teams:** Who share code snippets, logs, and other technical files.
*   **Anyone who finds Slack's native file management to be insufficient for their needs.**

## 3. Key Features

Based on the codebase, the following key features are either implemented or planned:

*   **Slack Integration:** The application is built around a deep integration with the Slack API. Users connect their Slack workspace to the application to access their files.
*   **File Browsing:** The core functionality is a dashboard that displays a user's Slack files in a grid view.
*   **Infinite Scrolling:** The application uses infinite scrolling to efficiently load and display a large number of files.
*   **File Search:** The marketing copy emphasizes "intelligent search," which suggests a more advanced search functionality than what is currently implemented. This could include features like:
    *   **Natural language search:** Allowing users to search for files using conversational language (e.g., "show me all the screenshots from last week").
    *   **Content-based search:** Searching the content of files, not just the filenames.
    *   **AI-powered search:** Using AI to understand the context of a user's search and provide more relevant results.
*   **File Management:** The application provides basic file management capabilities, including:
    *   **Downloading files:** Users can download individual or multiple files.
    *   **Deleting files:** Users can delete files from their Slack workspace.
*   **Workspace Management:** Users can connect and switch between multiple Slack workspaces.
*   **Authentication:** The application uses a robust authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access their files.

## 4. Technical Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js with Turbopack
    *   **Language:** TypeScript
    *   **UI:** HeroUI, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
    *   **Data Fetching:** TanStack React Query
    *   **State Management:** Zustand
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js API Routes
    *   **Language:** TypeScript
    *   **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
    *   **Authentication:** better-auth
*   **Integrations:**
    *   **Slack API:** For accessing and managing files.
    *   **PostHog:** For product analytics.

## 5. Future Potential

The "intelligent search" feature is the most significant area for future development. By leveraging AI and machine learning, SlackShots could become an indispensable tool for anyone who uses Slack. Other potential features include:

*   **File organization:** Allowing users to create folders, add tags, and otherwise organize their files.
*   **File previews:** Providing rich previews for a wider range of file types.
*   **Advanced filtering and sorting:** Giving users more control over how they view their files.
*   **Team-based features:** Allowing teams to collaborate on file management.

## 6. Summary

SlackShots is a promising application that addresses a real pain point for Slack users. By providing a dedicated interface for file management and leveraging AI for advanced search, it has the potential to become a "must-have" tool for anyone who relies on Slack for their work. The current codebase provides a solid foundation for building out these features and realizing the full vision of the product.
